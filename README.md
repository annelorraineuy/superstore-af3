For any changes to graphics, you can update the github repo here. Do let us know so we can pull :)

You can work on the server side scripting here. Use this version to test your scripts in Intel XDK. Keep an open line of communication so we can do this as efficiently as possible :D

If you have any questions, you know where to reach me.

Your project manager,

Anne
